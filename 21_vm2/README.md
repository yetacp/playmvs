# C interpreter that interprets itself.

Original source code: https://github.com/lotabout/write-a-C-interpreter 

## How to Run the Code

File `xc.c` is the original one and `xc-tutor.c` is the one that I make for
the tutorial step by step.

```
gcc -o xc xc.c
./xc hello.c
./xc -s hello.c

./xc xc.c hello.c
./xc xc.c xc.c hello.c
```

## About

This project is inspired by [c4](https://github.com/rswier/c4) and is largely
based on it.

However, I rewrote them all to make it more understandable and help myself to
understand it.

Despite the complexity we saw in books about compiler design, writing one is
not that hard. You don't need that much theory though they will help for
better understanding the logic behind the code.

Also I write a series of article about how this compiler is built under directory `tutorial/en`.

There is also a chinese version in my blog.
